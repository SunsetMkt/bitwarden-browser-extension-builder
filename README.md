## Description

Sunsetvault is an exclusive build of the popular open source password manager, designed for internal use by SETG.

This extension is designed for internal use but still may be used by the public. The user must have a server implementation to connect to because our server is not accessible from the internet. However, it's strongly recommended to use the official build of the extension if you are not a member of the team. We won't be responsible for any personal data or financial losses.

You may also check its [upstream source](https://github.com/bitwarden/clients) and our [build workflow](https://github.com/SunsetMkt/Sunsetvault).

**This project is not associated with [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) or Bitwarden, Inc.**

## Development Notice

> We have changed the icons because of [TRADEMARK GUIDELINES](https://github.com/bitwarden/server/blob/main/TRADEMARK_GUIDELINES.md).

> We have changed the name because of DMCA Notice.

Run the workflow and download the releases.

**For beginners, it's always recommended to use the latest official build of your password manager.**

To load the built extension on Chromium-based browsers, [load an unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked) or [self-hosting Chromium extensions](https://www.meziantou.net/self-hosting-chromium-extensions.htm).
